# 1. Promises
A powerful tool for handling asynchronous actions in your code is JavaScript promises. They give you a means to deal with the outcomes of an asynchronous operation, like a network request, without blocking the execution of the rest of your code. A promise can be in one of three states — fulfilled, rejected, or pending — and it symbolises the final result of an asynchronous operation.

In comparison to employing callback functions, promises offer a mechanism to handle the outcomes of an asynchronous action in a more streamlined and controlled manner. Additionally, they make it easier to handle errors in a consistent way and chain several asynchronous tasks together.
