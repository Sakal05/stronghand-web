**JavasScript** is unargualbly one  of the most *popular programming language* in the world and is used to create interactive websites and web application. For deveopers, learning _javaScript_ can lead to a wealth of opportunities duet to its strength and versatility. in this article, we will explore 10 key concepts that can help you imporve your **javaScript** mastery and take your skills to the next level.These concepts will offer you a strong foundation in the language and assist you in developing into a more competent and **confident developer**.

# 1. Promises
**A powerful tool** for handling asynchronous actions in your code is _JavaScript promises_. They give you a means to deal with the outcomes of an asynchronous operation, like a network request, without blocking the execution of the rest of your code. A promise can be in one of three states — fulfilled, rejected, or pending — and it symbolises the final result of an asynchronous operation.

In comparison to employing callback functions, promises offer a mechanism to handle the outcomes of an asynchronous action in a more streamlined and controlled manner. Additionally, they make it easier to handle errors in a consistent way and chain several asynchronous tasks together.


Promises are used extensively in JavaScript libraries and frameworks, such as AngularJS, ReactJS, and Node.js. Introduced in ES6, they are a fundamental concept for modern JavaScript development. Your code’s readability, maintainability, and performance can all be considerably enhanced by knowing how to use promises correctly.


In using JavaScript promises, the “promise” object is a constructor that creates a new promise and takes a single argument, which is a function called the "executor". The executor function takes two parameters, “resolve” and “reject” which can be used to indicate whether the asynchronous operation has succeeded or failed.


Let’s look at the following example:

```javascript
    const promise = 
    new Promise
    ((resolve, reject) 
    => {
    // some asynchronous 
    operation
    if (success) {
        resolve(value);
    } else {
        reject(error);
    }
    });
```

Once a promise is created, you can use its “then” method to attach callbacks that will be invoked when the promise is resolved, and its “catch” method to attach callbacks that will be invoked when the promise is rejected. Alternatively, you can manage several promises simultaneously by using the Promise.all() and Promise.race() methods. Promises are available in all modern JavaScript environments and are supported in all major browsers, so you can use them with confidence in your projects.

# 2.Async/Await

The **async function** declaration declares an async function where the await keyword is permitted within the _function body_. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous, promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need to explicitly configure **promise chains**.

try for example....

```javascript

function resolveAfter2Seconds() {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve('resolved');
    }, 2000);
  });
}

async function asyncCall() {
  console.log('calling');
  const result = await resolveAfter2Seconds();
  console.log(result);
  // Expected output: "resolved"
}

asyncCall();

```

# Syntax

``` javascript

async function name(param0) {
  statements
}
async function name(param0, param1) {
  statements
}
async function name(param0, param1, /* … ,*/ paramN) {
  statements
}

```

## Parameter
name

 >The function's name.

param

>The name of an argument to be passed to the function.

statements

>The statements comprising the body of the function. the _await_ mechanism may be used.

Return value

A [Promise]() which will be resolved with the value rturned by the async function, or rejected with an exception thrown from , or uncaught within, the async function
